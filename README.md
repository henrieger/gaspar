# GASPAR
## Genetic Algorithm for Searches under Parsimony

GASPAR is a phylogenetic inference software powered by a genetic algorithm aimed at analysis using morphological data, inspired by [GARLI](https://code.google.com/archive/p/garli/). Its main use case is for research in paleontology.

GASPAR is currently under development, as well as its documentation. It is only available as a self-compiled project in Linux via Makefile. Official releases are soon to come.

This was my graduation thesis, and a paper describing the software can be found [here](https://www.inf.ufpr.br/bcc/tcc/2024/2024%20Algoritmo%20Gen%C3%A9tico%20para%20Busca%20de%20Filogenias%20com%20Dados%20Morfol%C3%B3gicos.pdf) (in Portuguese).
